## SWeVA-Repository-Service

This service hosts modules and components for the SWeVA platform.

### Installation


Compile the service with 
```sh
ant
```
then run start_network in ./bin.

You will need a local mongoDB installation running on the (default) port 27017
The rest is the same, as for the [LAS2peer-Template-Project](https://github.com/rwth-acis/LAS2peer-Template-Project)
